# IMD-Text-Data-Handler
This repo shows how to preprocess the IMD station rainfall data. Indian Meteorological Department is the parent body for all types of weather data for India. 
They have a wide network of weather stations through out the Republic of India. However to order the data you have to be a part of a government or scientific body which works in the hydrometeorological applications.
You can order data by signing into IMD Data Supply. After ordering data, the data comes in a text format. Hpwever the  text format and the data arrangement in the text are difficult to start working with. Therefore this code implementation will help in preprocessing the 
IMD text file and  to make the data in a computational format. I have also uploaded the sample text data text data which can be opened using excel.
