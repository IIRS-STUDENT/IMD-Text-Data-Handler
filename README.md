# IMD-Text-Data-Handler
This repo shows how to preprocess the IMD station rainfall data. Indian Meteorological Department is India's parent body for all types of weather data. 
They have a wide network of weather stations throughout the Republic of India. However to order the data you have to be a part of a government or scientific body that works in the hydrometeorological applications.
You can order data by signing into IMD Data Supply. After ordering data, the data comes in a text format. However, the  text format and the data arrangement in the text are difficult to start working with. Therefore this code implementation will help in preprocessing the 
IMD text file and  preprocess the data in a computational format. I have also uploaded the sample text data, which can be opened using Excel.
